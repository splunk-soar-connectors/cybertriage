<html><head></head><body>Currently the only action that has been implemented is <b>scan endpoint</b> which initiates a Cyber Triage collection. Other actions will be implemented in the future. The username and password configuration variables refer to a user that must have administrative privilleges on all remote machines that collections will be performed on. Verification of the username and password does not occur in the <b>test connectivity</b> action. Credentials will be checked in the <b>scan endpoint</b> action. Verify_server_cert is disabled by default. It should only be enabled if you have created your own certificate and imported it into your Cyber Triage server and Phantom instance.</body></html>
