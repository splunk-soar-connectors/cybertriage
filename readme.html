<p><a href="https://www.cybertriage.com/?utm_source=Phantom">Cyber Triage</a> allows you to perform a mini-forensic investigation on an endpoint. It pushes a collection tool to the remote endpoint to collect volatile and file system data and analyzes the data.  
</p>

<p>
This plug-in allows you to perform a collection as part of your playbook.  It requires that you have the Team version of Cyber Triage.  </p>

<p>The primary action of this plug-in is <b>scan endpoint</b>, which sends the Cyber Triage collection tool to the specified endpoint. To use this action,  you must specify:
<ul>
  <li>Target endpoint</li>
  <li>Username with admin privileges</li>
  <li>Password of the admin user</li>
</ul></p>

<p>To setup the action, you will need to specify the:
<ul>
  <li>Hostname of the Cyber Triage server / REST API</li>
  <li>Server key (that you can get from the Cyber Triage Server options panel)</li>
</ul></p>

<p>The <b>test connectivity</b> action allows you to test that Phantom can communicate with the Cyber Triage server.</p>

<p>If you configured Cyber Triage to use your own SSL certificate, then change the <b>verify_server_cert</b> property to true and import your certificate into <a href="https://my.phantom.us/kb/16/">Phantom Certificate Store</a>.</p>

<p>If you have any problems, then please email support@cybertriage.com.  </p>
